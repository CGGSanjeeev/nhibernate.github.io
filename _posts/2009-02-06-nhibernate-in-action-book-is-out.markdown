<p>I'm excited to announce that the <a title="NHibernate in Action at Manning Press" href="http://www.manning.com/kuate/">NHibernate in Action book</a> is finally out of print and available to buy!</p>
<p>I got my box of books this morning, they're looking great :D</p>
<p>As with all Manning books, there are a few <a title="NHibernate in Action at Manning Press" href="http://www.manning.com/kuate/">free chapters</a> posted up online. Enjoy!</p>
