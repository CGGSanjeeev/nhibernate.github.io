<p>Mapping views with NHibernate just got a whole lot easier. Previous to revisions committed to the trunk today (Dec 15, 2008) there was no good way to exclude certain files from being exported with a schema export. </p>
<p>Now a new attribute has been added to the &lt;class&gt; schema. </p>
<p>&lt;class name="Cat" schema-action="none|drop|export|update|validate|all"&gt; ...</p>
<p>Using this to map a view is easy:</p>
<p>&lt;class name="CustomersView" table="CustomsReportView" schema-action="none" mutable="false"&gt; ...</p>
<p>This will automatically exclude this class from all schema actions such as updates, drops, and exports. You can mix and match with schema-action="update,drop" etc.</p>
