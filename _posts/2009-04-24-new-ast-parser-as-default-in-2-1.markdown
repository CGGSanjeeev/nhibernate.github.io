<p>Our newest commiter Steve Strong has been working on a new AST parser for HQL. The new AST parser currently passes NH Test suite, however it may have some bugs that are not covered by NH Test suite.We now have to decide whether to include new parser as default in 2.1 distribution and we care for your thoughts. </p>

<p><b>An important note by Ayende:</b></p>
<p><b>It is important to note that no matter how this survey goes, you are
always going to be able to revert back to the old parser by setting a
single config value.</b></p>
