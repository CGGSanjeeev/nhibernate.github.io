<p>Yes, it has been a few days since&nbsp;<a href="/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2008/09/30/nhibernate-spatial-1-0-0-beta1-released.aspx">1.0.0 Beta1 release</a>, but why we should wait so much for more goodness? :-)</p>
<p>Beta2 brings a new MySQL spatial dialect and gets Npgsql updated to 2.0RTM. &nbsp;You can download it <a href="/media/g/spatial/default.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
