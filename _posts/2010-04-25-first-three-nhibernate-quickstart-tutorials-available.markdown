<p>As some of you may already know, I've begun work on a series of NHibernate tutorials as the first steps in a larger effort to help update the NHibernate reference documentation.</p>
<p>For many users, starting out with NHibernate is less of a learning curve and more of a learning cliff - so the intent with this first article series is to gradually expose the user to the features of NHibernate, from basic mapping through advanced techniques.</p>
<p>A couple of themes I am working to maintain through the tutorial series include not throwing too many new concepts in at once, and to keep the focus on the ORM side of the application and not get lost in the details of user interface implementation (although I plan on doing an MVC example in a later tutorial).&nbsp; Another key part is that through the initial series of tutorials, I'll be building on a common frame of reference that can be used to better illustrate examples as&nbsp;I move from the tutorial portion and onto the FAQ/How-To and reference sections.</p>
<p>My current plan is to publish a new segment each week for review, so any feedback or technical corrections are greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>You can find the first three tutorials at these links:</p>
