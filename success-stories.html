<p>I am the COO at a Boise, ID based mobility company. Whenever possible  (approx 10-15 applications) we use NHibernate in the server side component of our mobility solutions. I've used this product for many years and am constantly amazed by both the ever improving functionality and the incredible support of the community. If you have concerns about bringing an OSS product into your tool stack then I urge you to take this one for a spin. I am certain if you are prepared to invest some time into learning the paradigm that you will quickly wish that you had taken the plunge years ago.</p>

<p>We are Senior Developers at a large format print company, Hudson's also a developer on the Fluent NHibernate project. We use NHibernate exclusively on an EAV greenfield project that allows our clients to manage their proprietary data. It's been an absolute dream, especially coming from a pure ADO/Dataset world where Stored Procedures drove much of the data access, to using a near seamless ORM like NHibernate. We weighted NHibernate against the Entity Framework, and a few other ORMs (such as ORMapper) and NH came up well ahead of the rest as the leader of the pack. It's a very mature framework, and we have nothing but appreciation and respect for the community that continues to improve this OSS product.</p>

<p>Prior to actually using NHibernate, I had heard rumors from other developers that NHibernate had a really steep learning curve, and had been a stumbling block for certain, well... 5:01 developers.  We are using Castle ActiveRecord (layered on top of NHibernate) at HSI for a couple of our new LOB products, and it couldn't have been easier to get it set up and start being productive.  It was just as easy to set up and use as other ActiveRecord OR/Ms I have used in the past like SubSonic and Linq2Sql, and from my perspective there is a lot more flexibility in terms of modeling entity graphs whose structure varies from the underlying database schema.  (Castle ActiveRecord actually supports much more than just the "Active Record" pattern of one object per table.)  It has been relatively easy to configure one class that corresponds to several tables, as well as several classes that correspond to a single table, and any sort of sane mapping of an inheritance hierarchy to a DB schema seems to be supported as well, so you really get the best of both worlds IMO with Castle ActiveRecord (all the ease-of-use of an "Active Record" type OR/M, coupled with the flexibility of NHibernate- since if necessary it seems that you can mix-and-match Castle ActiveRecord with 'plain vanilla NHibernate' in the same app).  I would highly recommend Castle ActiveRecord (and thus NHibernate) to anyone that is trying to select an OR/M for their .NET application.  If you don't like putting persistence information in your entities, you can use Fluent NHibernate, which I have heard provides equivelent functionality to Castle ActiveRecord, but it supports POCOs, although I have not used Fluent NH.</p>

<p>The international company I work for started coding a web based application in the mid-90's using asp/javascript. About three years ago I created the first .NET application and was allowed to use NHibernate (after the lawyers approved the licensing). Since then the stack has evoluted to using Castle, Rhino.Commons, NHibernate and now FluentNhibernate. As the infrastructure has expanded other development teams have started to leverage this stack for their deliverables. There was considerable resistance at first but as features that were delivered were stable and maintenance was easier this has become a non-issue. I am currently in my third refactor of the infrastructure using this stack. This will make the availability to the other teams even easier to use. Adding new features will be done via convention rather than configuration and the infrastructure will support the automagical wiring of the components. The biggest hurdle for using NHibernate has been the mapping but FluentNHibernate has made the mapping easier. It all started with NHibernate.</p>

<p><i><i>We have been developing solutions for world-class companies using NHibernate since 2006. Among the several solutions we built, there are internet-faced applications with more than 60.000 users and online transactional systems. The use of Nhibernate allow us to reduce the time spend on writing code for persistence and at the same time concentrate more on other concerns like business logic and user experience.</i></i></p>

<p>Used NHibernate as ORM of choice at several companies.  It is the most capable and pure ORM, there is little to no performance implications for using NHibernate due to it's flexibility.</p>
