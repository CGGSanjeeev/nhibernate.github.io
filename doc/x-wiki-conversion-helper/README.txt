This xslt and script was used to aid in the conversion of the wiki HTML pages
scraped from nhforge.org into the somewhat cleaner pages that are now (mostly)
found in the docs folder.

This is archived here in case it will be useful in any future conversion.

There was also a significant amount of manual adjuments. Also the xslt and
script are in no way a ready-to-go solution. Any future use of these is
likely to require changes.
